When we try to use wxpython on macbook, it will show this error:"This program needs access to the screen. Please run with a Framework build of python, and only when you are logged in on the main display of your Mac.", even if you have already installed wxpython the normal way you install other python packages. And if you google this problem like I did, you will find that python in mac cannot handle it, you have to use pythonw (.py to ,pyw).
I took this suggestion, and tried to use pythonw to run the demo again, this problem seems gone, but somehow it was still not working.
Then I tried multiple solutions given online, none of them worked (I'll skip those failed attempts). That's when I realize the easiest way for me is to build an virtual environment to get a "fake windows". Now I'll show you how I did it.
